# Vision_Script
#### 16/03/2024
### Requirements for use: Deno v1.41.3 and newer. To install, see link at the bottom of the page.
This is a minimalistic interpreted programming language made with TypeScript and Deno. It has some fundamental features but still very basic. Keep in mind I am only 12 years old and not a professional programmer. 
I also want to give credit to @tylerlaceby 's tutorial series on how to make a programming languge in typescript as it has given me a good foundation.

This programming language uses the .vsc file type. You can find a test file in the TestProject folder.

To run a piece of code, go to the Vision_Script folder in a terminal and type in this command:                                                                    
        `deno run -A vision.ts`                                                                                                        
 Then, enter the path to the vsc file from the Vision_Script folder.

# Features implemented in this language:
1. Binary operations
2. Print Function `Print:"Hello world";
3. Variable Declarition:
   Variable: `Let x = 5;`
   Constant: `Let foo = 2;`
4. If Statement: `If : foo = 4;:
Print:foo;  ;` (Still Incomplete)
5. Input function: `in;` Variable: `Let x = in;`
